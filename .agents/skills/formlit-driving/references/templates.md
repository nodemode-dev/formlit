# formlit built-in templates

Generated from formlit's template library; do not edit by hand. `list_templates` returns the same with a `query`; `apply_template` applies one by id or name; `setup_shoot` runs a whole shoot recipe.

Metadata placeholders: {creator} {email} {url} (remembered after the first use), {client} {event} {job} (per call), {year} (this year). A field whose placeholder has no value is skipped.

## Export presets

| Preset | Group | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JPEG for Web (2048 px) (`builtin.web`) | General |  |
| Full Size JPEG (`builtin.full`) | General |  |
| For Email (1200 px) (`builtin.email`) | General |  |
| 16-bit TIFF, ProPhoto RGB (`builtin.tiff`) | General |  |
| Print, 300 ppi Adobe RGB (`builtin.print`) | General |  |
| Original Files (`builtin.original`) | General |  |
| DNG with Edits (`builtin.dng`) | General |  |
| Ultra HDR JPEG (gain map) (`builtin.hdr`) | General |  |

| Proofs (1200 px, centred watermark) (`builtin.proof`) | Client Delivery | Small proofs for choosing, with a large faint watermark across the middle so they cannot stand in for the finals. |
| Print Lab (sRGB JPEG, 300 ppi) (`builtin.print-lab`) | Print | Full size, high-quality sRGB JPEG for consumer and pro labs (Mpix asks for sRGB; Bay Photo and WHCC also take Adobe RGB; WHCC prints most products at 300 dpi, Mpix and Bay Photo size at 250). |
| Stock Agency (sRGB JPEG, full size) (`builtin.stock`) | Licensing | Full-size sRGB JPEG with all metadata; Adobe Stock and Shutterstock both ask for JPEG in sRGB of at least 4 MP, so do not crop below that. |
| News Filing (JPEG, full metadata) (`builtin.news`) | Licensing | Full-size JPEG that keeps every IPTC field (caption, creator, credit, location) for a picture desk. |
| Real Estate MLS (3000 px, under 6 MB) (`builtin.mls`) | Web and Social | sRGB JPEG with the long side at 3000 px and each file under 6 MB. MLS rules vary (Canopy MLS caps at 3000 x 3000 and 6 MB; Canopy and Unlock MLS both ask for at least 2048 x 1536), so check yours. |
| Instagram (1080 px wide) (`builtin.instagram`) | Web and Social | 1080 px wide sRGB JPEG; Instagram's help says it keeps photos up to 1080 px across. Crop to 4:5 portrait or 1:1 first if you want them to fill the feed. |
| Blog and Website (1600 px) (`builtin.blog`) | Web and Social | 1600 px long side, lighter file for web pages. |
| 4K Display (3840 px) (`builtin.4k`) | Web and Social | 3840 px long side for 4K screens, slideshows and portfolio sites. |
| Archive Master (16-bit TIFF, Adobe RGB) (`builtin.archive`) | Print | Lossless 16-bit TIFF in Adobe RGB with all metadata, for a finished master to keep. |

## Filename templates

| Template | Pattern | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filename (unchanged) (`filename`) | `{name}` | Keeps the camera's file name. |
| Name - Sequence (`custom-seq`) | `{custom}-{seq:3}` | Shoot or client name plus a three-digit count; the usual delivery naming. |
| Name - Camera Frame Number (`custom-num`) | `{custom}-{num}` | Custom name plus the camera's own frame number, so names still trace back to the card. |
| Date - Camera Name (`date-filename`) | `{date:%Y%m%d}-{name}` | Capture date in front of the camera name; sorts by day in any file browser. |
| Date - Sequence (`date-seq`) | `{date:%Y-%m-%d}-{seq:4}` | Capture date and a four-digit count. |
| Date and Time - Original Number (`datetime-num`) | `{date:%Y%m%d_%H%M%S}_{num}` | Capture time to the second plus the frame number; unique even for bursts. |
| Shoot Name - Filename (`shoot-filename`) | `{custom}-{name}` | Shoot name in front of the camera name. |
| Client_Date_Sequence (`client-date-seq`) | `{custom}_{date:%Y%m%d}_{seq:4}` | Client or job, capture date and count; a common studio delivery pattern. |
| Creator_Date_Sequence (`creator-date-seq`) | `{creator}_{date:%Y%m%d}_{seq:4}` | Photographer, date and count; needs a creator in the metadata (a metadata template at import sets it). |
| Time-sorted Multi-camera (`multicam`) | `{date:%Y%m%d-%H%M%S}-{camera}-{num}` | Capture time first, then body and frame: files from several cameras interleave in shooting order. Set every camera's clock to the same time before the shoot. |
| Wire: Date_Creator_Sequence (`wire`) | `{date:%Y%m%d}_{creator}_{seq:3}` | Date, photographer and count for news and sports filing; needs a creator in the metadata. |
| Listing - Sequence (`listing-seq`) | `{custom}-{seq:2}` | Property address or listing id as the custom text and a two-digit order, the order the listing shows them. |
| SKU - Sequence (`product-sku`) | `{custom}_{seq:2}` | Product SKU as the custom text and a view number (01 front, 02 back and so on). |
| City_Date_Sequence (`city-date-seq`) | `{city}_{date:%Y%m%d}_{seq:3}` | City from the metadata, date and count; for travel work. |
| Title - Sequence (`title-seq`) | `{title}-{seq:2}` | Title from the metadata and a count; for portfolio and print files. |
| Folder - Sequence (`folder-seq`) | `{folder}-{seq:4}` | The folder's name and a count. |
| Rating - Filename (`rating-filename`) | `{rating}star-{name}` | Star rating in front of the name, so selects sort to the top. |

## Folder templates

| Template | Pattern | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| By date: 2026/2026-10-07 (`year-day`) | `{date:%Y}/{date:%Y-%m-%d}` | Year, then one folder per day. |
| By date: 2026/10 (`year-month`) | `{date:%Y}/{date:%m}` | Year, then month. |
| By date: 2026-10-07 (`day`) | `{date:%Y-%m-%d}` | One folder per day. |
| Year / Date Shoot Name (`year-day-shoot`) | `{date:%Y}/{date:%Y-%m-%d} {custom}` | Year, then a job folder that starts with the date so jobs sort in order (the custom text is the shoot name). |
| Year / Shoot Name (`year-shoot`) | `{date:%Y}/{custom}` | Year, then the shoot name. |
| Clients / Client / Date (`clients`) | `Clients/{custom}/{date:%Y-%m-%d}` | A folder per client (the custom text), then per day. |
| By camera: Camera / Date (`camera-day`) | `{camera}/{date:%Y-%m-%d}` | One folder per body, then per day; keeps a second shooter's cards apart. |
| Into one folder (`one`) | `(none)` | Everything into the destination folder. |
