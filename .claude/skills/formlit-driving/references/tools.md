## get_catalog

The catalog: name and counts, folders (id, path, count), collections (id, name, kind, count) and keywords. Use the ids as find_photos sources.

- no parameters

Note: read-only.

## find_photos

Lists photos: source picks where (kind all, folder, collection, keyword, person, previousImport, quick, ids), filter narrows (text, which also takes field operators such as iso>=3200, rating>=3, camera:x100, lens:35; rating with ratingOp >= <= =, flags [pick reject none], labels, kinds [raw jpeg video...], edited, cameras, lenses, keywords [ids], dates [YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD]), sort orders (by captureTime, importTime, editTime, fileName, rating; desc). Returns ids with file, capture time, rating, flag, label and size.

- `source`: object
- `filter`: object
- `sort`: object
- `limit`: integer; default 200

Note: read-only.

## get_photo

One photo in full: path, camera, lens, exposure, GPS, metadata, keywords, collections and develop settings.

- `id`: integer; required; A photo id from find_photos.

Note: read-only.

## get_preview

The photo as developed, as a JPEG image (long side max_size; 512 is enough to judge a look and costs a quarter of 1024). values renders proposed develop values without saving them; preset (an id or name from list_presets) with amount previews a preset before apply_preset; before true shows it with no edits; analyze true adds the compact measurement of the same render.

- `id`: integer; required; A photo id from find_photos.
- `max_size`: integer; default 768
- `values`: object; Develop ids to values, e.g. {"light.exposure": 0.5}.

- `amount`: number; default 100
- `before`: boolean; default false
- `analyze`: boolean; default false

Note: read-only.

## analyze_photo

Measures a photo as developed, or with proposed values or a preset without saving: luminance percentiles and tonal zones (blacks, shadows, midtones, highlights, whites), clipping, saturation, colour cast in neutral areas, the share and strength of each colour-mixer band, and findings with suggested develop values. Use it before and after edits instead of judging exposure by eye. Pass ids instead of id for one compact line per photo and the spread across the set.

- `id`: integer; A photo id from find_photos.
- `ids`: array; Photo ids from find_photos.
- `values`: object; Proposed develop ids to values.
- `preset`: string
- `amount`: number; default 100

Note: read-only.

## match_look

Matches photos to a reference photo's look in one call: measures the reference as developed, then adjusts each target's exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks, saturation, white balance and colour-mixer saturation and luminance over several internal render rounds until tone and colour converge. Returns the changes and the distance before and after. Use it when the person points at an example ("make these look like this one") or to make a set consistent; then add creative grading or masks.

- `reference`: integer; required; A photo id from find_photos.
- `strength`: number; default 100
- `tone`: boolean; default true

## import_photos

Adds photos from folders or files (absolute paths) to the catalog the way working photographers ingest: mode add keeps them in place, copy or move put them under destination, dng copies as DNG. folderTemplate builds the folders (default {date:%Y}/{date:%Y-%m-%d}); renameTemplate renames files with tokens {custom} {shoot} {date:%Y%m%d} {seq:4} {name} {camera} {iso}; metadata applies a copyright preset to every file ({"copyright": ..., "creator": ..., "city": ...}); develop applies a preset id at import; backup makes a second copy in another folder; buildPreviews standard or 1:1; collection adds them to a collection id.

- `ids`: array; required; Photo ids from find_photos.

## match_exposures

Lightroom's Match Total Exposures: evens out the brightness of a run of photos of the same scene to the first id (the best-exposed frame), using their exposure metadata. For bracket sets and uneven series; match_look also matches colour.

- `ids`: array; required; Photo ids from find_photos.
- `report`: boolean; default false; Return a compact measurement of each changed photo (median, end points, contrast, clipping, saturation, cast, issues) so no separate analyze_photo call is needed.

## add_ai_mask

Adds a local adjustment through an AI mask: sky, subject, background, people, object (with box [x0,y0,x1,y1] 0 to 1), depth, or parts: kind people with parts (faceSkin, bodySkin, eyebrows, sclera, iris, lips, teeth, hair, clothes; person for one person by index) or kind landscape with parts (sky, water, vegetation, mountains, architecture, naturalGround, artificialGround), several parts in one mask. adjust uses local ids: exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks, temp, tint, hue, saturation, texture, clarity, dehaze, sharpness, noise, plus a local colour grade: colorHue (0 to 359) with colorSat (0 to 100) tints the masked area, and curve ({"master"|"red"|"green"|"blue": [[x, y], ...]}, 0 to 1) is a local tone curve. To grade a subject and its background differently, add a subject mask and a background mask with different adjust values. The result reports each mask's coverage of the frame; an empty mask is refused. Each kind runs a local model (subject and background: U2-Net; people: U2-Net human segmentation; face, hair, eye, lip and teeth parts also need the YuNet face model; sky: the sky segmenter; object: SAM 2.1; depth: Depth Anything V2); a refusal names the exact install call.

Real estate and interiors: blends a tripod bracket into one DNG. Ambient frames are merged as HDR; a flash frame gives the room clean colour (flambient: light from the ambient frames, colour from the flash); windows are pulled from the darker frames in darken mode so frames and mullions stay and flash reflections on glass go. flash names the flash frame (else the one tagged Flash fired); windowEv sets how many stops the view sits above the room.

## retouch_skin

Batch skin retouching for a portrait session: on every photo with a face, a Skin Retouch mask over face and body skin (smooth softens texture, shine tames bright skin) and heal spots on blemishes it finds (red spots only while keepFreckles is on, so freckles and moles stay). Everything lands as normal editable settings; photos without a face are skipped; running again replaces its own mask and spots. Check a result with get_preview. Needs the faces and people models.

- `ids`: array; required; Photo ids from find_photos.
- `smooth`: number; default 40
- `shine`: number; default 0
- `blemishes`: boolean; default true
